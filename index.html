						<h2>A little about me...</h2>
						<p>I am a developer who continually strives to learn new technologies and seek out process
							improvements. I have a strong media background which allows me to work well with both
							creatives and users to understand their struggles and seek out solutions.</p>
						<p>I have a penchant for strategic process improvement and enjoy developing modern
							implementations based on tried and true solutions.</p>
						<p>I am very passionate about problem solving and exploring new ways to solve old problems. I've
							used these skills to write scripts, develop automation, and pioneer new systems to increase
							efficiency for a variety of tasks.</p>

				<h2>What I've accomplished...</h2>
				<p>I always want to be learning and pushing the boundries of my education. Here are some of my most
					recent works which implement new technologies or practice programming concepts I wish to develop a
					mastery over.</p>

						<h3>Warp Point Logisitcs</h3>
						<img class="image left screenshot" src="images/scsh_warp_point.jpg" />
						<p>This was a solo project to create a logistics site. Users can register/login as a customer or a carrier. Customers can create orders by selecting a start and end point. Server side does pathfinding to get the most efficient route and displays the cost for shipping. Carriers can view all unclaimed orders that they can accept. Dashboards track active orders according to the user type.</p>
						<p>This project was created with a react front end and express server for the backend. MongoDB for storing data. Bcrypt and jwt-token for projecting user credentials.</p>

						<h3>Math Chat</h3>
						<img class="image right screenshot" src="images/scsh_math_chat.jpg" />
						<p>This application features a calculator which shares equation results in a real-time chat log with other users. The express server is hosted on heroku to handle the sockets while the front end is handle by react.</p>
						<p>This app was created using React, Express, and Socket.io</p>

						<h3>Hex Map Pathfinding</h3>
						<img class="image left screenshot" src="images/scsh_hex_pathfinding.jpg" />
						<p>This was a challenge to myself to create a scalable hex map that could then utilize
							pathfinding algorithms to connect a start and end point. Users can draw walls and watch
							as the algorithm solves for the most efficient path. (algorithm slowed down for user visualization)</p>
						<p>This project practiced pathfinding algorithms as well as trigonomitry to create the hex
							shapes for the map.</p>

						<h3>Shadowrun Fixer</h3>
						<img class="image right screenshot" src="images/scsh_shadowrun_fixer.jpg" />
						<p>This app was created to assist players in managing combat in the table-top system Shadowrun
							3.0. Users are walked through the steps of a combat round; entering in all relevant values
							from easy to use tables and dropdown lists.</p>
						<p>This project was my introduction to React as well as Redux.</p>

						<h3>Bad Movie Challenge</h3>
						<img class="image left screenshot" src="images/scsh_bad_movie.jpg" />
						<p>This was a collaborative project with 4 other developers. Users can register/login and search
							a database of movies to challenge themselves or their friends to watch. Lists of users
							watched movies
							and challenges are stored in an SQL database.</p>
						<p>This project practiced the Model, View, Controller design pattern; user authentication;
							password encryption; and database storage as well as team collaboration.</p>

						<h3>Weather Dashboard API</h3>
						<img class="image right screenshot" src="images/scsh_weather_api.jpg" />
						<p>This weather dashboard uses openweathers api to display location forecast data. Users last
							searches are saved locally so they can quickly view the forecast for their previous
							searches.
						</p>
						<p>This honed my mastery of bootstrap, local storage, as well as consuming 3rd party API
							documentation.</p>
